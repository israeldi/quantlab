A band of six perfectly logical, bloodthirsty pirates must divide a chest of 300 gold coins. The pirates are ranked by authority. The top pirate is the captain, and he proposes how the gold should be distributed. All of the pirates then vote yea or nay. If there are more nays than yeas, the captain is thrown overboard, and the next takes his place. This is repeated until there are at least as many yeas as nays, at which point the gold is distributed. Every pirate wants to survive, and if he survives, he wants as much gold as he can get.
